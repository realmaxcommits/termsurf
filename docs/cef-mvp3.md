# CEF MVP3: Precise Pane Matching

## Goal

The browser must always match the precise position and dimensions of its pane.

## Requirements

1. **Position**: The browser's top-left corner must be at the pane's top-left
   corner. Always.

2. **Size**: The browser's width and height must equal the pane's width and
   height. Always.

3. **Responsiveness**: When the pane changes (window resize, split, unsplit,
   drag divider), the browser must update to match near-instantaneously.

4. **No overflow**: The browser must never extend beyond its pane boundaries. It
   must never cover adjacent panes or UI elements.

5. **Temporary stretching is acceptable**: During resize transitions, the
   browser texture may be temporarily stretched or compressed. This is fine as
   long as it immediately corrects itself to match the new pane dimensions at
   1:1 scale.

6. **Unconditional stretching**: The current texture is always stretched to
   match the pane dimensions exactly. No gaps, no bands, no overflow. The
   viewport is set to the pane bounds, period.

7. **Acceptable transient state**: Stretching is acceptable only as a brief
   transient state while waiting for CEF to produce a correctly-sized texture.

## Technical Approach

1. **Single detection point**: Pane resize detection must happen in exactly one
   place. We detect pane changes, not window changes. The pane is the source of
   truth.

2. **Pixel coordinates, not grid**: Use precise pixel bounds, not grid
   calculations (cols × cell_width). Grid-based sizing causes chunky resizing.
   The browser must resize continuously to the pane's exact pixel dimensions.

3. **Re-render loop**: When CEF finishes rendering a new texture, we check if
   the pane has changed since we requested the render. If it has (e.g., user is
   still dragging), we request another render. This continues until the texture
   matches the current pane size.

## Non-Goals for MVP3

- Perfect frame-by-frame synchronization (minor lag is acceptable)
- Avoiding all visual artifacts during resize (temporary stretch is fine)
- Input handling improvements
- Navigation controls

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:

- You can resize the window and the browser fills the pane exactly
- You can split the pane and the browser shrinks to match the new smaller pane
  exactly
- You can close a split and the browser grows to match the larger pane exactly
- You can drag pane dividers and the browser resizes to match exactly
- At no point does the browser overflow into adjacent panes or leave gaps
