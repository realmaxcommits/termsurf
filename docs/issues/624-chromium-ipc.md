# Issue 624: Chromium IPC

## Goal

Understand how Chromium's processes communicate internally — what processes
exist, what IPC mechanisms they use, and specifically how input reaches the
renderer and how rendered frames reach the display. This knowledge will inform
how to replace TermSurf's current XPC message-passing with something faster.

## Background

### The latency problem

TermSurf runs Chromium out-of-process. The GUI (Ghostty fork) communicates with
a Chromium Profile Server over XPC. This works, but every interaction has
visible lag:

```
Mouse event → Zig Surface → XPC to Chromium → Chromium processes input →
renderer paints → compositor composites → capturer captures (timer) →
IOSurface → XPC to GUI → next CVDisplayLink vsync → Metal composites
```

[Issue 619](619-input-latency.md) measured this at 15–25ms average, 1–2 frames
of extra latency versus native Chrome. Three sources: the FrameSinkVideoCapturer
running on its own timer (0–8ms), async XPC dispatch (1–3ms each direction), and
a double-vsync penalty.

### What we tried and abandoned

[Issues 620](620-zig-content-shell.md)–[623](623-viz-display-serialization.md)
spent 25 experiments across four issues trying to run multiple browser profiles
in a single Chromium process. If multiple `BrowserContext`s could coexist at
60fps, there would be no IPC at all — the GUI would host Chromium in-process.

The attempt failed. Two BrowserContexts with JavaScript animations degrade to
2fps. [Issue 621](621-single-process.md) isolated the trigger to JavaScript on
the Blink main thread (CSS animations are immune).
[Issue 622](622-javascript-is-slow.md) proved both conditions are required —
multiple BrowserContexts AND JavaScript.
[Issue 623](623-viz-display-serialization.md) debunked the leading theory (Viz
Display serialization). After 25 experiments, the root cause remains unknown.

### The new direction

Rather than continue debugging the single-process 2fps mystery, we're pursuing
the multi-process architecture that TermSurf already uses — but making it
faster. The key insight from Issue 619's research: **Chrome itself is
multi-process, yet achieves 1-frame latency.** Chrome's browser process,
renderer processes, and GPU/Viz process are all separate — the same kind of
cross-process architecture TermSurf has. Chrome stays fast because its
performance-critical paths use shared memory, not message passing.

Issue 619 identified that Chromium uses shared memory ring buffers for GPU
commands and shared GPU textures (IOSurface) for frame data. Mojo on macOS uses
Mach ports — the same kernel mechanism as XPC. The transport is not the
bottleneck. What matters is what travels over it.

Before we can adopt these patterns, we need to deeply understand how they
actually work in Chromium's codebase.

### What we already know (from Issue 619)

Issue 619's research established:

- **GPU Command Buffer** — renderers write GL-equivalent commands into a shared
  memory ring buffer (`gpu/command_buffer/client/cmd_buffer_helper.h`). Hundreds
  of commands batch before a single IPC notification.
- **CompositorFrames are metadata, not pixels** — a `CompositorFrame` contains
  texture references and draw quads. Zero pixel data crosses the boundary.
- **Mojo uses Mach ports on macOS** — `MOJO_USE_APPLE_CHANNEL` buildflag,
  `channel_mac.cc` implements transport via `mach_msg`.
- **Compositor-thread input handling** — `cc/input/InputHandler` handles scroll
  on the compositor thread without touching the main thread.
- **CALayerParams** — Chrome's normal display path uses `ca_context_id` for
  zero-copy GPU compositing, or `io_surface_mach_port` as a fallback.

But this was a high-level survey. We need to trace the actual code paths.

## Research questions

### 1. What processes exist when viewing a web page?

We know the broad categories (browser, renderer, GPU/Viz) but need the precise
picture:

- Exactly how many processes does Content Shell spawn for one tab? For two tabs?
- Which process is the "browser process" — is it the one that calls
  `ContentMain()`, or does Chromium spawn a separate one?
- Where does the GPU/Viz process get created? Is it always a separate process,
  or can it run in-process?
- Are there other processes (utility, network, audio) relevant to rendering?

### 2. How do they communicate?

The IPC landscape in Chromium is layered and confusing. We need to understand
the stack:

- **Mojo** — Chromium's primary IPC framework. What exactly is it? Message
  pipes, data pipes, shared buffers — how do these map to OS primitives?
- **Legacy IPC** — does any of it remain, or is everything Mojo now?
- **Shared memory** — how does Chromium create and share memory regions across
  processes? What API (`base::SharedMemory`, `base::WritableSharedMemoryRegion`,
  platform-specific)?
- **Mach ports** — how are they used beyond Mojo channels? IOSurface transfer,
  task ports, etc.

### 3. What IPC protocols exist?

- What Mojo interfaces carry rendering-critical messages?
- What is the `viz.mojom.CompositorFrameSink` interface?
- What is the `viz.mojom.DisplayClient` / `viz.mojom.DisplayPrivate` interface?
- What carries input events from browser to renderer?

### 4. Where is shared memory used?

The GPU Command Buffer uses shared memory. What else does?

- **Bitmaps / raster buffers** — are software-rasterized tiles shared via shared
  memory?
- **Input events** — are they sent as Mojo messages or through shared memory?
- **Frame metadata** — is the CompositorFrame itself in shared memory, or
  serialized over a Mojo message pipe?
- **Sync tokens / fences** — are these in shared memory or IPC messages?

### 5. How does user input reach the renderer?

Trace the complete path for a mouse click:

- Where does the browser process receive the OS event?
- How does it decide which renderer gets it?
- What Mojo interface carries the event?
- Does the event go directly to the renderer, or through the GPU/Viz process?
- How does the compositor thread receive it for scroll/selection?
- What is the latency of this path?

### 6. How does the rendered frame reach the display?

Trace the complete path for a rendered pixel:

- Renderer rasterizes into... what? GPU textures? Shared memory bitmaps?
- The CompositorFrame is submitted to... where? The GPU process? The browser
  process?
- How does the GPU/Viz process aggregate frames from multiple renderers?
- How does the final composited result reach the screen on macOS?
- What is `CALayerParams`? Where is it produced and consumed?
- What is a `ca_context_id`? How does `CALayerHost` work?

## Approach

Source code research only — no code changes, no builds. Read the Chromium source
in `chromium/src/` to trace the actual code paths. The goal is a detailed map of
the IPC architecture that we can use to design TermSurf's replacement for XPC
message-passing.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Map Chromium's IPC architecture

A source code research experiment — no code changes, no builds. Read the
Chromium source in `chromium/src/` to answer all six research questions. The
goal is a concrete, code-referenced map of every process, IPC mechanism, and
data path involved in rendering a web page.

#### Q1: What processes exist?

Trace how Content Shell spawns its process tree.

**Where to look:**

- `content/browser/browser_main_loop.cc` — browser process initialization. What
  child processes does it launch?
- `content/browser/gpu/gpu_process_host.cc` — GPU/Viz process launch. Is it
  always out-of-process? What flags control in-process GPU?
- `content/browser/renderer_host/render_process_host_impl.cc` — renderer process
  creation. How does `GetProcessHostForSiteInstance()` decide whether to create
  a new process or reuse one?
- `content/browser/utility_process_host.cc` — utility processes. Is the network
  service a utility process?
- `content/public/common/content_switches.h` — flags like `--single-process`,
  `--in-process-gpu`, `--no-sandbox`. What do they control?

**Deliverable:** A process tree diagram showing exactly what processes exist for
a Content Shell instance with one tab loading a page with JavaScript.

#### Q2: How do they communicate?

Map the IPC stack from OS primitives up to application-level interfaces.

**Where to look:**

- `mojo/public/cpp/system/` — Mojo primitives. What are message pipes, data
  pipes, shared buffers, and platform handles? How do they map to kernel
  objects?
- `mojo/core/` — Mojo core implementation. How does a Mojo message pipe become
  an actual OS-level transport?
- `mojo/public/cpp/platform/platform_channel.cc` — how channels are created.
  What OS primitive is used on macOS?
- `mojo/core/channel_mac.cc` — macOS channel implementation. How does it use
  `mach_msg`? How are Mach ports bootstrapped between processes?
- `ipc/ipc_channel_mojo.cc` — the legacy IPC layer on top of Mojo. Is this still
  used for anything rendering-critical?
- `content/browser/child_process_launcher.cc` — how the browser process creates
  a child and establishes the initial Mojo connection.

**Deliverable:** A layered diagram: OS primitives (Mach ports, shared memory) →
Mojo transport → Mojo interfaces → application-level calls.

#### Q3: What Mojo interfaces carry rendering traffic?

Identify the specific `.mojom` interfaces on the rendering-critical path.

**Where to look:**

- `services/viz/public/mojom/compositing/compositor_frame_sink.mojom` — the
  interface between renderer and Viz. What methods does it have? How are
  CompositorFrames submitted?
- `third_party/blink/public/mojom/widget/platform_widget.mojom` — or whatever
  carries input events from browser to renderer.
- `content/common/renderer.mojom` — renderer-side Mojo interface. What
  rendering-relevant methods exist?
- `services/viz/privileged/mojom/compositing/` — privileged Viz interfaces used
  by the browser process.
- `content/browser/renderer_host/input/input_router_impl.cc` — how input events
  are routed. What Mojo interface do they travel on?

**Deliverable:** A list of the Mojo interfaces on the hot path for input and
frame submission, with their method signatures.

#### Q4: Where is shared memory used?

Find every place shared memory is used in the rendering pipeline.

**Where to look:**

- `gpu/command_buffer/common/cmd_buffer_common.h` — the GPU command buffer ring.
  How is the shared memory region created and mapped?
- `gpu/command_buffer/client/cmd_buffer_helper.h` — client-side command buffer.
  How does the renderer write commands without IPC per call?
- `gpu/command_buffer/service/command_buffer_service.cc` — GPU-side command
  buffer. How does the GPU process consume commands?
- `base/memory/shared_memory_region.h` — Chromium's shared memory abstraction.
  How are regions created, duplicated across processes, and mapped?
- `base/memory/platform_shared_memory_region.h` — platform-specific
  implementation. What macOS API does it use? (`mach_vm_allocate`? `shm_open`?
  `mmap`?)
- `components/viz/common/resources/transferable_resource.h` — how GPU textures
  are referenced across processes. Are they shared memory or GPU handles?
- `gpu/ipc/common/gpu_memory_buffer_impl_io_surface.cc` — IOSurface as shared
  GPU memory. How is this created and shared?

**Deliverable:** A catalog of shared memory uses in the rendering pipeline: what
data lives in shared memory, how regions are created, and how they're shared
between processes.

#### Q5: How does user input reach the renderer?

Trace a mouse click from the OS event to the renderer's compositor thread.

**Where to look:**

- `content/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_view_mac.mm` — where macOS
  delivers NSEvents. How does `mouseDown:` get processed?
- `content/browser/renderer_host/render_widget_host_input_event_router.cc` — how
  the browser process routes events to the correct renderer.
- `content/browser/renderer_host/input/input_router_impl.cc` — the input router.
  What Mojo interface sends events to the renderer?
- `content/renderer/input/widget_input_handler_impl.cc` — renderer-side input
  handling. How does the event reach the compositor thread?
- `cc/input/input_handler.cc` — compositor-thread input handling. How does
  scroll get handled without the main thread?
- `third_party/blink/renderer/platform/widget/input/widget_input_handler_manager.cc`
  — how input is dispatched between compositor and main threads in the renderer.

**Deliverable:** A sequence diagram from `NSEvent` to compositor thread action,
with every process boundary and IPC hop labeled.

#### Q6: How does the rendered frame reach the display?

Trace a rendered pixel from rasterization to the screen on macOS.

**Where to look:**

- `cc/trees/layer_tree_host_impl.cc` — how the compositor produces a
  CompositorFrame. What does `SubmitCompositorFrame()` do?
- `services/viz/public/mojom/compositing/compositor_frame_sink.mojom` — the Mojo
  interface for frame submission. Is the CompositorFrame serialized or
  referenced?
- `components/viz/service/display/display.cc` — how the Display aggregates
  frames and draws. What is the output?
- `components/viz/service/display_embedder/output_surface_provider_impl.cc` —
  how the output surface is created on macOS.
- `ui/accelerated_widget_mac/accelerated_widget_mac.mm` — how `CALayerParams`
  are produced and delivered.
- `ui/accelerated_widget_mac/display_ca_layer_tree.mm` — how `CALayerHost` is
  created from a `ca_context_id`.
- `ui/gfx/ca_layer_params.h` — the struct that carries the display result. What
  fields does it have?
- `gpu/ipc/service/gpu_memory_buffer_factory_io_surface.cc` — how IOSurface
  buffers are created in the GPU process.

**Deliverable:** A sequence diagram from `SubmitCompositorFrame()` to pixels on
screen, with every process boundary, GPU operation, and macOS Window Server
interaction labeled.

#### Verification

Research is complete when we can draw two end-to-end diagrams:

1. **Input path:** OS event → browser process → renderer process → compositor
   thread, with every IPC mechanism (Mojo message pipe, shared memory, Mach
   port) labeled at each hop.
2. **Frame path:** Renderer rasterization → CompositorFrame submission → Viz
   aggregation → display output → macOS screen, with every IPC mechanism and GPU
   memory sharing technique labeled.

Both diagrams should reference specific source files and line numbers. The
diagrams should make it clear which steps use message passing (and could be
replaced with shared memory) and which already use shared memory or zero-copy
GPU textures.
