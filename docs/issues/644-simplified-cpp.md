# Issue 644: Simplified C++ Profile Server

## Goal

Replace the Content Shell fork with a minimal, purpose-built C++ profile server.
The current `chromium_profile_server` carries ~100 Content Shell files we never
modify. Strip it down to only what TermSurf needs: a thin executable that
creates BrowserContexts, manages WebContents, handles XPC, and streams CAContext
IDs back to the GUI. No Shell windows, no DevTools frontend, no Content Shell
boilerplate.

## Background

### The Content Shell problem

The current Chromium Profile Server (`chromium_profile_server`) is a fork of
Content Shell — Chromium's reference embedder. Content Shell is designed to be a
complete minimal browser with its own window, toolbar, DevTools, and test
infrastructure. TermSurf uses none of that. We subclass a few Content Shell
classes, override path resolution, and add XPC handling. But the build target
pulls in ~100 files of Content Shell code: `ShellBrowserMainParts`,
`ShellContentBrowserClient`, `ShellWebContentsViewDelegate`,
`ShellDevToolsFrontend`, `ShellJavaScriptDialog`, and dozens more.

This creates three problems:

1. **Upgrade friction.** Every Chromium version upgrade risks merge conflicts in
   Content Shell files we don't own. The more Content Shell code we depend on,
   the more conflicts we face.

2. **Complexity.** Understanding what our server actually does requires
   separating our ~1,050 lines from Content Shell's thousands. New contributors
   see 100+ files and can't tell which ones matter.

3. **Unnecessary code.** Content Shell creates Shell windows, handles DevTools,
   manages JavaScript dialogs, and implements test-specific behaviors. None of
   this is relevant to a headless profile server that streams CAContext IDs over
   XPC.

### What Issues 642–643 taught us

Issues 642–643 attempted to solve this by rewriting the server in Zig. The
Zig-to-Chromium bridge works (dlopen, C API shim, WebContents creation,
CAContext IDs), but XPC integration never worked end-to-end across 7
experiments. The failure pattern: standalone Chromium works, but the full GUI →
XPC → server → GUI pipeline doesn't.

The lesson isn't that Zig is wrong — it's that the rewrite was too ambitious.
Changing the language AND the build system AND the deployment AND the XPC
implementation all at once made failures hard to diagnose. A simpler approach:
keep C++, keep the working build system, but strip out Content Shell.

### What we actually need

The profile server needs exactly these capabilities:

- **ContentMain entry point** — initialize Chromium
- **BrowserContext** — create isolated browser profiles with persistent storage
- **WebContents** — create headless web pages, navigate, resize
- **Compositor** — persistent compositor for stable CAContext IDs
- **XPC** — connect to the GUI gateway, receive commands, send back events
- **Input forwarding** — route mouse, keyboard, scroll events to WebContents
- **Observation** — URL, title, loading state, cursor changes → XPC messages

Content Shell provides all of this, but buried under layers of Shell-specific
abstractions. A simplified server implements these directly against the Content
API.

## Approach

Create a new directory `chromium/src/content/termsurf_browser/` with a minimal
Content API embedder. Start from scratch — not by forking Content Shell, but by
implementing only the required Content API interfaces. Use the existing
`chromium_profile_server` as a reference for what works, but don't copy its
Content Shell dependencies.

The key Content API classes to implement:

- `ContentMainDelegate` — app initialization, creates the browser client
- `ContentBrowserClient` — creates the BrowserContext, configures the browser
- `BrowserMainParts` — lifecycle hooks (pre-main-message-loop, post-startup)
- `BrowserContext` — profile storage, cookie/cache path configuration
- `WebContentsDelegate` — handles navigation, title changes, new windows
- `WebContentsObserver` — observes loading state, URL changes

Everything else — Shell windows, DevTools frontend, JavaScript dialogs, test
infrastructure — is omitted.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Restore the Working C++ Profile Server

Before changing anything, get back to a known-good state. Issues 642–643 left
behind uncommitted Zig code in the main repo and switched the Chromium fork to
branches with the `zig_profile_server` target. The existing C++ profile server
(`chromium_profile_server`) still works — we just need to point at the right
branch and clean up.

#### Clean up the main repo

Delete all Zig profile server code from Issues 642–643:

**Delete the `browser/` directory entirely.** This was created for the Zig
profile server and is no longer needed. Committed files (`browser/build.zig`,
`browser/src/main.zig`) and uncommitted files (`browser/build.zig.zon`,
`browser/macos/Info.plist`, `browser/macos/PkgInfo`) all go.

**Restore `gui/src/apprt/xpc.zig`.** The uncommitted change points the server
path at `Zig Profile Server.app`. Revert it to the committed version, which
points at `Chromium Profile Server.app`:

```
"{s}/dev/termsurf/chromium/src/out/Default/Chromium Profile Server.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium Profile Server"
```

#### Create the Chromium branch

The last branch with a working C++ profile server is `146.0.7650.0-issue-639`
(open new-tab links in same tab). The `issue-642` and `issue-643` branches have
the `zig_profile_server` target, not `chromium_profile_server`.

Create `146.0.7650.0-issue-644` from `146.0.7650.0-issue-639`. Add it to
`docs/chromium.md`.

#### Build and verify

```bash
cd chromium/src
git checkout 146.0.7650.0-issue-644
export PATH="$(cd ../depot_tools && pwd):$PATH"
autoninja -C out/Default chromium_profile_server

cd ../../gui && zig build
open zig-out/TermSurf.app
```

Type `web google.com` in a terminal pane. Expected: web page renders, mouse
clicks work, keyboard input works, URL bar updates, page title syncs. All
features that were working before Issues 642–643 should work again.

#### Pass criteria

The C++ profile server works end-to-end with all previously-working features:
web rendering, mouse input, keyboard input, resize, navigation, URL sync, page
title sync.

#### Result: Pass

The C++ profile server works end-to-end. Web rendering, mouse input, keyboard
input, resize, navigation, URL sync, and page title sync all function correctly.
We are back to a known-good baseline.
