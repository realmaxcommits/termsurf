# `new-tab-button-click`

{{since('20230326-111934-3666303c')}}

The `new-tab-button-click` event is emitted when the user clicks on the
"new tab" button in the tab bar. This is the `+` button that is drawn
to the right of the last tab.

The first event parameter is a [`window` object](../window/index.md) that
represents the gui window.

The second event parameter is a [`pane` object](../pane/index.md) that
represents the active pane in the window.

The third event parameter is an indication of which mouse button was clicked.
The following values are possible:

* `"Left"` - the left mouse button
* `"Right"` - the right mouse button
* `"Middle"` - the middle mouse button

The last event parameter is a [KeyAssignment](../keyassignment/index.md) which
encodes the default, built-in action that wezboard will take.  It may be `nil`
in the case where wezboard would not take any action.

You may take any action you wish in this event handler.

If you return `false` then you will prevent wezboard from carrying out its
default action.

Otherwise, wezboard will proceed to perform that action once your event
handler returns.

This following two examples are equivalent in functionality:

```lua
wezboard.on(
  'new-tab-button-click',
  function(window, pane, button, default_action)
    -- just log the default action and allow wezboard to perform it
    wezboard.log_info('new-tab', window, pane, button, default_action)
  end
)
```

```lua
wezboard.on(
  'new-tab-button-click',
  function(window, pane, button, default_action)
    wezboard.log_info('new-tab', window, pane, button, default_action)
    -- We're explicitly going to perform the default action
    if default_action then
      window:perform_action(default_action, pane)
    end
    -- and tell wezboard that we handled the event so that it doesn't
    -- perform it a second time.
    return false
  end
)
```
