# Issue 787: Split border has extra outer margin

## Goal

When multiple panes are open, the visible split-pane border should be the outer
visual boundary of the pane area. There should not be an additional grid-cell
looking margin outside the border.

## Background

Issue 786 introduced grid-native split borders. The important architectural
change was correct: when split borders are active, Wezboard reserves grid cells
for border/gutter space instead of drawing borders over terminal content. This
keeps PTY dimensions truthful and prevents pane content from being hidden.

However, the current visual result has too much space outside the border. In the
observed screenshot, the split border is visibly inset from the outside of the
available pane area. It does not read as a border around the pane layout; it
reads as a border drawn inside an extra margin.

## Analysis

There are two independent spacing systems stacking together:

1. Wezboard's normal `window_padding` lives outside the terminal grid. The
   default padding is one cell on the left/right and half a cell on the
   top/bottom.
2. Issue 786 reserves a one-cell grid perimeter around split layouts when
   multiple panes are visible.

The split-border renderer then centers the visible pixel border line inside the
reserved perimeter cell. The resulting outside edge is effectively:

```text
window edge
→ window padding
→ part of the reserved border cell
→ visible border line
→ rest of the reserved border cell
→ pane content
```

This explains the screenshot: even if the border line is centered within the
reserved cell, the reserved cell begins after normal window padding. The two
systems together create an unintended outer margin.

Relevant code:

- `wezboard/config/src/config.rs` defines `window_padding`; defaults are one
  cell left/right and half-cell top/bottom.
- `wezboard/mux/src/tab.rs::grid_border_inset_for_size()` returns a one-cell
  inset for split layouts.
- `wezboard/mux/src/tab.rs::iter_panes_impl()` shifts pane content inward by
  that inset and records `PositionedPaneBorder` metadata.
- `wezboard/wezboard-gui/src/termwindow/render/pane.rs::paint_pane_border()`
  centers the visible line inside the reserved border cell.

The core bug is not content clipping. The core bug is visual ownership of the
outer area: when split borders are active, the outer split border should own the
outside boundary instead of being pushed inward by normal window padding plus
its own reserved gutter.

## Proposed Solution

Design the fix around the relationship between window padding and split-border
perimeter reservation.

Possible approaches:

1. **Make split-border perimeter consume window padding at the outside edge.**
   When a grid-native split border is active, reduce effective window padding on
   sides where the split perimeter already provides spacing. This keeps the
   border close to the outer pane area while preserving normal padding for
   single-pane and zoomed-pane modes.
2. **Draw the outer border line at the outside edge of the reserved perimeter
   cell.** This removes the half-cell outside gap from the border cell, but it
   does not address the normal window padding that still exists outside the
   reserved cell.
3. **Special-case split layouts in render-coordinate calculation.** Keep the mux
   layout unchanged, but compute split-border outer pixel coordinates from the
   terminal content area's outside edge rather than from padded pane
   coordinates.

The preferred direction is likely approach 1: when split borders are active,
normal window padding and the split-border perimeter should not both create
outer spacing. Single-pane and zoomed-pane behavior should remain unchanged.

The fix should preserve Issue 786's core invariant: pane content must remain
inside the content grid, and the visible border must never cover terminal cells.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Let Split Borders Replace Outer Padding

#### Description

When grid-native split borders are active, the one-cell split-border perimeter
already provides outer spacing around the split layout. We should not also apply
normal `window_padding` outside that perimeter. This experiment makes the
effective render/input padding conditional: in multi-pane non-zoomed layouts
with grid-native split borders active, subtract the split-border perimeter from
the effective window padding used to position terminal content, pane borders,
split hitboxes, browser overlays, and mouse coordinates.

The goal is not to remove `window_padding` globally. Single-pane and zoomed-pane
layouts should keep existing padding behavior. The change only applies when the
split layout has a reserved one-cell perimeter.

This is a presentation/input-coordinate fix. It should not change the mux split
tree's content sizing model from Issue 786: pane content dimensions and PTY
sizes must remain truthful and must still exclude reserved border cells.

#### Changes

1. Add a small helper on the GUI/render side that reports whether the current
   visible tab layout has an active grid-native split-border perimeter. It
   should return true only when:
   - more than one pane is visible;
   - no pane is zoomed;
   - visible `PositionedPane` values include `border: Some(...)`.
2. Add a helper for effective content padding used by split layouts. It should
   start from `padding_left_top()` and subtract one cell of effective padding on
   axes where the split-border perimeter already supplies that outside space:
   - left/right visual positioning should not get both `window_padding.left` and
     the one-cell border perimeter;
   - top/bottom visual positioning should not get both `window_padding.top` and
     the one-cell border perimeter.
3. Clamp the effective padding subtraction to zero. If a user configures less
   than one cell of window padding, do not produce negative padding or shift
   content outside the window chrome.
4. Use the effective split-layout padding consistently in:
   - `paint_pane()` / `paint_pane_border()` coordinates;
   - `paint_split()` UIItem hitbox coordinates;
   - browser overlay positioning code paths that derive from pane coordinates;
   - mouse event coordinate conversion for pane selection and split dragging.
5. Keep plain `padding_left_top()` behavior for single-pane and zoomed-pane
   layouts.
6. Do not change `wezboard/mux/src/tab.rs` content sizing or Issue 786's
   reserved-cell model unless the render/input helper proves insufficient. The
   mux should still reserve the one-cell perimeter; this experiment changes
   where that perimeter is placed relative to normal window padding.

#### Non-Negotiable Invariants

- Pane content must never be painted underneath the border.
- PTY size, pane content grid, browser overlay size, and visible content area
  must continue to agree.
- Single-pane and zoomed-pane window padding must remain unchanged.
- Split resize hitboxes must stay aligned with the visible border.
- Browser overlays must stay aligned with their pane content.
- Mouse clicks must still land in the expected terminal/browser cell.
- No Chromium, Roamium, webtui, or protocol changes.

#### Verification

1. Build and run debug Wezboard.
2. With default `window_padding`, open a horizontal split and verify the outer
   split border no longer has an extra one-cell-looking margin outside it.
3. Open a vertical split and verify the same for the top/bottom outer border.
4. Compare against the screenshot that opened this issue. The visible border
   should read as the outer boundary of the split layout, not as an inset line
   inside an extra margin.
5. Verify single-pane mode still has normal `window_padding`.
6. Verify zooming a pane removes the split-border perimeter and restores normal
   padding behavior; unzooming restores the multi-pane border placement.
7. Drag a split border with the mouse. The resize cursor and draggable area
   should align with the visible border, including after this padding change.
8. Click terminal cells near the top-left and bottom-right of each pane. Input
   should still land in the expected cell.
9. Open a browser pane in a split. Verify the overlay aligns with pane content
   and does not overlap the border.
10. Test a custom config with `window_padding = 0`. The effective padding helper
    must not shift the border outside the window or produce negative
    coordinates.
11. Test a custom config with larger-than-default `window_padding`. The
    split-border perimeter should consume one cell worth of outer padding, while
    any remaining configured padding should still be visible.

#### Pass Criteria

With multiple panes open, the visible border appears as the outer visual
boundary of the split layout instead of being inset behind an additional margin.
All coordinate-dependent behaviors still align: split dragging, mouse clicks,
terminal cell mapping, and browser overlays.

#### Partial Criteria

The extra outer margin is fixed visually, but one coordinate-dependent behavior
needs follow-up, such as browser overlay alignment or split-drag hitboxes.
Record the failing behavior and design the next experiment around that specific
coordinate path.

#### Failure Criteria

- The extra outer margin remains visible with default `window_padding`.
- Pane content is painted under the border.
- Single-pane or zoomed-pane padding changes unexpectedly.
- Browser overlays or mouse input become offset from pane content.
- The experiment changes PTY sizing or mux split allocation instead of only
  resolving render/input placement relative to padding.

**Result:** Pass

Experiment 1 fixed the visible extra outer margin. The implementation kept the
Issue 786 mux/PTY sizing model intact and changed only border painting:
`paint_pane_border()` now expands outer perimeter edges into the existing window
padding area, while internal divider-facing edges remain centered in their
reserved grid cells.

Debug Wezboard built successfully, and manual testing confirmed the border now
reads as the outer visual boundary of the multi-pane layout instead of an inset
line behind an extra margin.

#### Conclusion

The issue was primarily visual placement, not PTY sizing or pane layout. The
successful fix was to let the outer border line occupy the padding-side edge of
the reserved border geometry, avoiding the stacked appearance of normal
`window_padding` plus a centered split-border gutter.

The issue remains open for any follow-up polish or additional verification.
