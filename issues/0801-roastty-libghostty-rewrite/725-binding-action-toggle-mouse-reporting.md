# Experiment 725: Binding Action Toggle Mouse Reporting

## Description

Experiment 724 finished the nearby runtime-control forwarding actions. Upstream
Ghostty's remaining adjacent `toggle_mouse_reporting` binding action is
different: it mutates surface-local configuration instead of forwarding an app
runtime action.

Upstream behavior:

- each surface has a `config.mouse_reporting` gate initialized from the
  `mouse-reporting` config option, defaulting to enabled;
- `toggle_mouse_reporting` flips that gate and consumes the binding action;
- mouse reports are sent only when both the surface gate is enabled and the
  terminal has an active mouse reporting mode;
- `surface_mouse_captured` follows the same combined gate.

Roastty already tracks terminal mouse modes and dispatches mouse reports, but it
does not have the separate surface-level gate yet. This experiment adds that
gate and the binding action. It does not implement full config parsing for the
`mouse-reporting` option; the initial Roastty value is the upstream default
`true`.

## Changes

- `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Add a `mouse_reporting: bool` field to `Surface`, initialized to `true`.
  - Extend `parse_binding_action` to accept `toggle_mouse_reporting` with no
    parameter and reject empty-colon or non-empty parameters.
  - Add a parsed binding-action variant or equivalent local action handling that
    toggles `Surface::mouse_reporting` and returns `true`.
  - Return `false` for null and detached surfaces, matching other local
    surface-mutating binding actions.
  - Update mouse reporting dispatch so mouse reports are suppressed when
    `mouse_reporting` is `false`, even if terminal mouse modes are active.
  - Update `roastty_surface_mouse_captured` so it returns `true` only when the
    surface is attached, has a worker, `mouse_reporting` is enabled, and the
    terminal has an active mouse reporting mode.
  - Keep all previously supported binding actions unchanged.

- `roastty/tests/abi_harness.c`
  - Add malformed `toggle_mouse_reporting` rejection checks.
  - Add valid no-worker coverage that `toggle_mouse_reporting` returns `true`
    without crashing.

- Tests in `roastty/src/lib.rs`
  - Cover parser false paths for `toggle_mouse_reporting:` and
    `toggle_mouse_reporting:now`.
  - Cover null and detached surfaces returning `false`.
  - Cover toggling the surface gate from `true` to `false` and back to `true`.
  - Cover `roastty_surface_mouse_captured` honoring the combined surface gate
    plus terminal mouse mode.
  - Cover mouse button and scroll reporting being suppressed while the surface
    gate is disabled, without losing stored mouse position/button/scroll state.
  - Re-run existing binding-action and mouse tests to prove previous behavior
    remains unchanged.

## Verification

Run:

- `cargo fmt -p roastty`
- `cargo test -p roastty toggle_mouse_reporting -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`
- `cargo test -p roastty mouse -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`
- `cargo test -p roastty binding_action -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`
- `cargo test -p roastty --test abi_harness`
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the Experiment 725 design and found no technical blockers. The
review approved the surface-local gate, combined gate with terminal mouse mode,
`mouse_captured` behavior, no-worker consumption, parser false paths, and
suppression-without-state-loss test plan.

The review also accepted deferring full `mouse-reporting` config parsing while
initializing Roastty's surface-local gate to upstream's default `true`.

The review found one workflow blocker: this design-review section still said
`Pending.` This section now records the review outcome, and the README tuple is
`Codex/Codex/-`.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

Roastty now accepts `toggle_mouse_reporting` as a parameterless local binding
action. The action flips a surface-local `mouse_reporting` gate initialized to
`true`, returns `false` for null or detached surfaces, and does not forward
through the runtime action callback.

Mouse report dispatch now requires both the surface gate and active terminal
mouse tracking. Button and scroll callbacks still store their latest state while
the gate is disabled, but they do not emit mouse reports or update reported-cell
state until the gate is re-enabled. `roastty_surface_mouse_captured` follows the
same combined gate.

Verification passed:

- `cargo fmt -p roastty`
- `cargo test -p roastty toggle_mouse_reporting -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`
  — 2 passed
- `cargo test -p roastty mouse -- --nocapture --test-threads=1` — 79 passed
- `cargo test -p roastty binding_action -- --nocapture --test-threads=1` — 88
  passed
- `cargo test -p roastty --test abi_harness` — 1 passed
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `git diff --check`

## Conclusion

`toggle_mouse_reporting` is complete at Roastty's current binding-action layer:
the parser, local surface mutation, capture gate, mouse report suppression, Rust
tests, and C ABI parser coverage all match the experiment plan. Full
`mouse-reporting` config parsing remains deferred as planned; the surface gate
uses upstream's default enabled state.

## Completion Review

Codex reviewed the completed experiment and found one workflow blocker: this
completion-review section still said `Pending.` The review found no
implementation blockers.

The review approved the surface-local gate initialized to `true`, local toggling
without runtime forwarding, false returns for null and detached surfaces,
no-worker consumption, `roastty_surface_mouse_captured` gating, mouse report
suppression while preserving stored button and scroll state, parser false paths,
Rust tests, C ABI harness checks, and verification record.
