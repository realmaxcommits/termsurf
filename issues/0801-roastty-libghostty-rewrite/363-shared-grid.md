# Experiment 363: the shared font grid (render path)

## Description

The font subsystem can resolve and shape glyphs (Experiments 339–362) and has
the lower-level rasterization primitives — `CodepointResolver::render_glyph` /
`get_presentation` and the `Atlas` — but nothing ties them into the central
object the renderer holds. This experiment adds the **`SharedGrid`**: it owns
the two glyph atlases (grayscale for text, BGRA for color), the
`CodepointResolver`, and the active grid `Metrics`, and provides
`render_glyph(index, glyph_index, opts)` — the call that rasterizes a shaped
glyph index into the correct atlas. This is upstream's `font/SharedGrid.zig`
render path. The glyph cache is deferred to a follow-up (its key needs a
hashable `RenderOptions`).

## Upstream behavior

Upstream `SharedGrid.renderGlyph(index, glyph_index, opts)`:

1. looks up a glyph cache keyed by `{index, glyph, opts}` (fast path);
2. on miss, gets the glyph's presentation via
   `resolver.getPresentation(index, glyph_index)` and selects the atlas —
   `.text → atlas_grayscale`, `.emoji → atlas_color`;
3. for emoji, overrides the constraint to `size = .cover`, centered, with a
   small pad (so the emoji scales to fill its cells without touching the edges);
4. calls `resolver.renderGlyph(atlas, index, glyph_index, render_opts)`, and on
   `error.AtlasFull` grows the atlas (`size * 2`) and retries once;
5. caches and returns the result.

roastty already has steps 2 and 4's primitives
(`CodepointResolver::get_presentation` / `render_glyph`, `Atlas::grow`); this
experiment is the `SharedGrid` that owns the atlases and performs the
presentation→atlas selection, the emoji constraint, and the grow-and-retry. Step
1 (the cache) is deferred.

    match resolver.render_glyph(atlas, index, glyph_index, opts) {
        Err(e) if is_atlas_full(&e) => {
            atlas.grow(atlas.size() * 2);

fn is_atlas_full(err: &ResolverRenderError) -> bool {
    matches!(
        err,
        ResolverRenderError::Render(RenderGlyphError::AtlasFull)
            | ResolverRenderError::Atlas(AtlasError::AtlasFull)
    )
}
```

This also adds a small `Atlas::size(&self) -> u32` accessor (the field is
private) so the grow-and-retry can double the size, and declares the module in
`font/mod.rs`.

## Scope / faithfulness notes

- **Ported (bridged)**: the `SharedGrid` struct (two atlases + resolver +
  metrics) and `render_glyph`'s presentation→atlas selection, emoji constraint
  override, and atlas grow-and-retry — upstream `SharedGrid.renderGlyph` minus
  the cache.
- **Faithful**: text → grayscale atlas, emoji → color atlas (via
  `get_presentation`); the emoji constraint is `cover`/centered with `0.025`
  left/right pad, matching upstream; `AtlasFull` grows to `size * 2` and retries
  once (both the face-render and sprite-reserve atlas-full conditions); the two
  atlases start at 512 px (`Grayscale` / `Bgra`), as upstream; `new` always
  configures the sprite font (`set_sprite_metrics(Some(metrics))`), matching
  upstream `SharedGrid.init`'s "always set up the sprite font" — so a sprite
  (box-drawing) index renders rather than returning `SpriteUnavailable`.
- **Faithful adaptation**: `render_into` is a free function taking the atlas and
  resolver as separate parameters so the disjoint `SharedGrid` fields are
  borrowed independently (a borrow-checker shape, not a behavior change); the
  emoji `RenderOptions` is built by struct-update (`..*opts`) since all fields
  are `Copy` — no clone needed; `SharedGrid::new` takes the `metrics` explicitly
  (upstream derives them from the collection during `init`; deriving/reloading
  metrics is out of scope here).
- **Deferred**: the **glyph cache** (upstream's
  `glyphs: HashMap<GlyphKey, Render>` fast path — its key includes
  `RenderOptions`, which needs a hashable form, a separate experiment), metrics
  reload on font change, and the Metal draw-path consumer that reads the
  atlases. (Consumed by tests now.)
- No C ABI/header/ABI-inventory change (internal Rust).

## Changes

1. `roastty/src/font/shared_grid.rs` (new): the `SharedGrid` struct, `new`,
   `render_glyph`, and the `render_into` / `is_atlas_full` helpers.
2. `roastty/src/font/atlas.rs`: add `pub(crate) fn size(&self) -> u32`.
3. `roastty/src/font/mod.rs`: declare `pub(crate) mod shared_grid;`.
4. Tests (in `shared_grid.rs`): build a Menlo `SharedGrid` and assert:
   - **text**: `render_glyph(Index::default(), glyph('M'), opts)` returns a
     `Glyph` with `width > 0`, `height > 0`; the reserved region fits inside the
     (un-grown, 512) grayscale atlas; and the success itself proves the
     text→grayscale selection — a monochrome glyph routed to the BGRA color
     atlas would have failed `InvalidAtlasFormat`.
   - **sprite**: `render_glyph(Index::special(Special::Sprite), 0x2500, opts)`
     (box-drawing horizontal line) returns a `Glyph` with `width > 0` — proving
     `new` configured the sprite font (without it this would be
     `SpriteUnavailable`).
5. Format and test (`cargo fmt`, accept output).

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo test -p roastty shared_grid
cargo test -p roastty
cargo build -p roastty            # no warnings
rg -n 'ghostty|Ghostty|GHOSTTY' roastty/src/font && exit 1 || true
rg -n 'ghostty|Ghostty|GHOSTTY' roastty/src/lib.rs roastty/include/roastty.h roastty/tests/abi_harness.c && exit 1 || true
git diff --check
```

The experiment **passes** if:

- `SharedGrid::render_glyph` selects the atlas by presentation, applies the
  emoji constraint, grows-and-retries on `AtlasFull`, and returns the rendered
  `Glyph` — faithful to upstream `SharedGrid.renderGlyph` (sans cache);
- the render test passes, and the existing tests still pass;
- the glyph cache, metrics reload, and Metal consumer stay deferred;
- `cargo fmt` accepted, `cargo build -p roastty` has no warnings, and
  `cargo test -p roastty` passes with no regressions;
- the no-`ghostty`-name gates and `git diff --check` pass;
- Codex reviews the design before implementation and the result after, with all
  real findings fixed.

The experiment **fails** if the atlas selection is wrong (text into color or
vice versa), the emoji constraint diverges, the grow-and-retry misbehaves, or
any public C API/ABI changes.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed this design before implementation and **approved** it with one
**Required** finding, now addressed:

- **Required (addressed):** `SharedGrid::new` must enable sprite rendering on
  the resolver. `CodepointResolver::new` starts with `sprite_metrics: None`, so
  a special (sprite) index renders as `SpriteUnavailable` until metrics are set;
  upstream `SharedGrid.init` explicitly always configures the sprite font
  because terminal rendering needs box-drawing glyphs.
  `new(mut resolver, metrics)` now calls
  `resolver.set_sprite_metrics(Some(metrics))` before storing, and a sprite
  render test (`Index::special(Special::Sprite)`, `0x2500`) guards against
  regression.

Codex confirmed the rest is sound: the presentation→atlas selection, the emoji
cover/center/`0.025`-pad constraint override, and the single grow-and-retry on
atlas-full match upstream's `renderGlyph`; matching both
`Render(RenderGlyphError::AtlasFull)` and `Atlas(AtlasError::AtlasFull)` is
correct (face rendering and sprite reservation report atlas-full through
different variants); deferring the glyph cache is an acceptable scope boundary
(each call still returns a valid placement — but it should be a near follow-up,
since repeated glyphs reserve duplicate atlas regions until the cache exists);
the `..*opts` Copy struct-update and the free `render_into` helper (disjoint
`&mut atlas_*` + `&resolver` borrows) are the right Rust shapes; and retrying
once (propagating a second failure) is faithful.
