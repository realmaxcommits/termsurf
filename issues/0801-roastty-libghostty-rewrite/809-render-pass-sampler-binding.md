# Experiment 809: Render Pass Sampler Binding

## Description

Wire the Metal sampler wrapper from Experiment 808 into
`roastty/src/renderer/metal/render_pass.rs`.

Upstream `renderer/metal/RenderPass.zig::Step` carries a `samplers` slice and
binds each present sampler with `setFragmentSamplerState:atIndex:` before the
draw call. Roastty currently binds buffers and textures but has no sampler field
on `MetalRenderPassStep`. This experiment adds the sampler binding path without
attempting window `Target`, `IOSurfaceLayer`, or full live frame orchestration.

The current Roastty Metal shaders use constexpr samplers for the existing
texture-sampling paths, so this is parity plumbing for the render-pass API and
future shader paths rather than a new visual feature.

## Changes

- `roastty/src/renderer/metal/render_pass.rs`
  - Import `MetalSampler`.
  - Add `samplers: &[Option<&MetalSampler>]` to `MetalRenderPassStep`.
  - Add a helper equivalent to upstream's sampler loop that binds each present
    sampler to its fragment sampler slot with `setFragmentSamplerState_atIndex`.
  - Call sampler binding after texture binding and before the draw call.
  - Update existing tests and call sites with `samplers: &[]`.
  - Add a focused device-backed smoke test that creates a `MetalSampler`, passes
    it through a texture-sampling render-pass step, completes the command frame,
    and verifies the rendered output still matches the expected sampled pixels.
    This proves the binding path is valid with `objc2-metal` and does not break
    existing draw behavior even though current shaders use constexpr samplers.
- `issues/0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md`
  - After implementation, update the Metal checklist row to mention render-pass
    sampler binding while keeping window `Target`, `IOSurfaceLayer`, and full
    live frame orchestration open.

## Verification

- Inspect:
  - `vendor/ghostty/src/renderer/metal/RenderPass.zig`
  - `roastty/src/renderer/metal/render_pass.rs`
  - `roastty/src/renderer/metal/sampler.rs`
  - `roastty/src/renderer/metal/shaders.metal`
- Run:
  - `cargo fmt -p roastty`
  - `cargo test -p roastty metal::render_pass -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`
  - `cargo test -p roastty metal::sampler -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`
- Run markdown formatting:
  - `prettier --write --prose-wrap always --print-width 80 issues/0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/README.md issues/0801-roastty-libghostty-rewrite/809-render-pass-sampler-binding.md`
- Run:
  - `git diff --check`

The experiment passes if `MetalRenderPassStep` supports sampler binding with
tested command-frame execution while the Metal row remains partial for window
`Target`, `IOSurfaceLayer`, and full live frame orchestration. It is Partial if
the step field lands but the smoke test exposes a binding issue needing
follow-up. It fails if sampler binding cannot be cleanly expressed with current
`objc2-metal` bindings.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed the design and approved it with no findings. The review confirmed
that adding a sampler slice to `MetalRenderPassStep`, binding present entries
fragment-only by index, and doing that before the draw call matches upstream
`RenderPass.zig`. The review also noted that the planned smoke test is
meaningful as a Metal encoder/API check, not proof of changed shader sampling
semantics, because current Roastty shaders use constexpr samplers. The scoped
README update keeps `Target`, `IOSurfaceLayer`, and full live frame
orchestration open.
