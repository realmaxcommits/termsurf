# Experiment 635: Collection Size Loading

## Description

Port the collection-size/load-size behavior for Roastty's CoreText font
collection.

Experiment 633 added deferred collection entries, but intentionally left the
physical resize path for a later experiment. That gap is now the next blocker
before the `Collection`/resolver/discovery checklist line can be audited: eager
fallback faces record a scale factor but are not resized, and deferred faces
load at CoreText's probe size until `Face::set_size` is called.

This experiment should give `Collection` an explicit point-size setting and use
it to resize loaded faces and future deferred loads. It should stay within the
existing macOS/CoreText scope and avoid introducing upstream's full
`DesiredSize` DPI structure unless a later renderer slice needs it.

## Upstream behavior

`vendor/ghostty/src/font/Collection.zig` stores `load_options.size`, resizes
eager faces on add when load options are present, resizes deferred faces after
load, and exposes `setSize` to update loaded faces plus future deferred loads.
Fallback faces use their recorded scale factor so the adjusted metric stays
aligned with the primary face.

Roastty's narrow equivalent can be:

- `Collection::set_point_size(points: f64)`;
- an optional collection point size stored on `Collection`;
- invalid point sizes are rejected before mutating the collection;
- empty/no-primary collections store the future point size but have no metrics
  to recompute yet, matching the existing `update_metrics` behavior that only
  errors when a caller explicitly asks for metrics;
- eager `add`/`add_with_adjustment` resize loaded faces when a point size is
  set;
- `load_deferred_entry` resizes loaded deferred faces using the resolved scale;
- existing metrics are recomputed after size changes.

## Changes

1. Update `roastty/src/font/collection.rs`:
   - add `point_size: Option<f64>` to `Collection`;
   - add `Collection::set_point_size(points: f64)`;
   - reject non-positive or non-finite point sizes with a small error enum;
   - resize every direct loaded entry to `points * scale_factor`;
   - update the stored point size for future deferred loads;
   - clear/recompute metrics only when a primary face is available; on an empty
     collection, keep the point size for future additions without fabricating
     metrics;
   - resize eager additions when a point size is already set;
   - resize deferred loads after their pending scale factor is resolved.
2. Tests:
   - setting the size resizes the primary face and updates metrics;
   - setting the size on an empty collection stores the future size and does not
     fabricate metrics;
   - setting the size after an adjusted fallback already exists resizes that
     fallback with its recorded scale factor;
   - setting the size before an eager fallback add resizes the added face with
     its scale factor;
   - setting the size before a deferred fallback load resizes the loaded face
     with its scale factor;
   - setting size on a collection with aliases resizes only direct entries and
     aliases continue to resolve;
   - invalid point sizes are rejected.

## Verification

- `cargo test -p roastty collection_size`
- `cargo test -p roastty collection_deferred`
- `cargo test -p roastty discovery_fallback`
- `cargo test -p roastty shared_grid`
- `cargo test -p roastty`
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check`
- `rg -n "physical resize to the collection size is deferred|collection-size / load-options path|Collection-size resize lands in a later experiment" roastty/src/font/collection.rs`
- `git diff --check`

Pass = loaded and deferred collection entries honor an explicit collection point
size, fallback scale factors are applied on resize/load, existing resolver and
shared-grid behavior stays green, and stale resize-deferred comments are gone.

Fail = resizing changes face priority/resolution, aliases duplicate resize work,
deferred loads ignore the stored point size, invalid sizes are accepted, or the
implementation grows beyond the macOS/CoreText scope.

## Design Review

**Reviewer:** Codex (gpt-5.5, medium) · resumed session
`019e8f83-9029-7d43-8e82-f4c5754e14ba`

**Verdict:** APPROVED.

Initial review found two required fixes: define `set_point_size` behavior for an
empty/no-primary collection, and add a test for resizing an already-loaded
adjusted fallback after setting the collection size. The plan now specifies that
empty collections keep the future point size without fabricating metrics and
adds the already-loaded adjusted fallback resize test. Follow-up review approved
the revised design.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

`Collection` now tracks an optional point size, rejects invalid sizes before
mutating state, resizes loaded direct entries when the point size changes, and
stores that size for future eager additions and deferred loads. Empty
collections keep the future size without fabricating metrics. Adjusted fallback
faces use their recorded scale factor both when they already exist and when they
are added or loaded after the size has been set.

The implementation stays inside the macOS/CoreText collection path. It does not
introduce upstream's full DPI-aware `DesiredSize` load options yet.

Verification passed:

- `cargo test -p roastty collection_size` — 7 passed, 3486 filtered
- `cargo test -p roastty collection_deferred` — 5 passed, 3488 filtered
- `cargo test -p roastty discovery_fallback` — 5 passed, 3488 filtered
- `cargo test -p roastty shared_grid` — 5 passed, 3488 filtered
- `cargo test -p roastty` — 3493 unit tests passed, 1 ABI harness test passed
- `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check` — pass
- `rg -n "physical resize to the collection size is deferred|collection-size / load-options path|Collection-size resize lands in a later experiment" roastty/src/font/collection.rs`
  — no matches
- `git diff --check` — pass

## Conclusion

Roastty's font collection now has the size state needed for loaded and deferred
CoreText faces to converge on the same physical point size behavior as Ghostty's
collection load-options path. The remaining collection/resolver audit can focus
on parity gaps outside size loading, especially sprite rendering tables,
shared-grid parity, OpenType helpers, embedded fonts, and Nerd Font attributes.
