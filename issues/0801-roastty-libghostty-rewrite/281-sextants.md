# Experiment 281: Sextants (U+1FB00–U+1FB3B)

## Description

The sextant glyphs from Symbols for Legacy Computing — a 2-column × 3-row grid
of cells, each glyph a subset of the six cells. Upstream
`font/sprite/draw/symbols_for_legacy_computing.zig` `draw1FB00_1FB3B` draws them
purely with `fill` and `Fraction` lines, which Experiment 278 already ported.
This is a clean fill-only family, parallel to the block-element quadrants.

## Upstream behavior (`draw1FB00_1FB3B`)

- `Sextants` (`packed struct(u6)`): six cell flags, bit order
  `tl, tr, ml, mr, bl, br` (bits 0–5).
- The 60 codepoints map to patterns by index: `idx = cp - 0x1FB00`;
  `sex = (idx + idx/0x14 + 1) as u6`. The `+ 1` skips the empty pattern (`0`),
  and the `+ idx/0x14` (0x14 = 20) skips the two patterns `0b010101` (left
  column = left half block `▌`) and `0b101010` (right column = right half block
  `▐`) that already have dedicated block-element codepoints. So the produced
  `sex` values run `1..=62` minus `{21, 42}`.
- Each set cell is filled (`fill(metrics, canvas, x0, x1, y0, y1)`):
  - columns: left `zero..half`, right `half..full`;
  - rows: top `zero..one_third`, middle `one_third..two_thirds`, bottom
    `two_thirds..end`.
  - `tl→(zero,half, zero,one_third)`, `tr→(half,full, zero,one_third)`,
    `ml→(zero,half, one_third,two_thirds)`,
    `mr→(half,full, one_third,two_thirds)`, `bl→(zero,half, two_thirds,end)`,
    `br→(half,full, two_thirds,end)`.

## Rust mapping (`roastty/src/font/sprite/draw.rs`)

Reuses the in-module `Fraction`/`fill`, `Canvas`, and test helpers.

- `struct Sextants { tl, tr, ml, mr, bl, br: bool }` with
  `fn from_cp(cp: u32) -> Sextants`:
  `let idx = cp - 0x1FB00; let sex = ((idx + idx / 0x14 + 1) & 0x3F) as u8;`
  then decode bits `0x01..0x20` in the upstream order.
- `fn draw_sextant(cp: u32, metrics: &Metrics, canvas: &mut Canvas) -> bool`:
  returns `false` unless `0x1FB00 <= cp <= 0x1FB3B`; otherwise decodes the
  pattern and `fill`s each set cell with the upstream `Fraction` pairs.

## Scope / faithfulness notes

- **Deferred**: the rest of the Symbols-for-Legacy-Computing file (smooth
  mosaics, separated blocks, etc.) — several of those glyphs use `canvas.line`
  (the `z2d` path API, not yet ported), so only the fill-only sextant subset is
  done here. The `z2d` primitives, the other sprite families, and the unifying
  sprite `has_codepoint`/draw entry point remain deferred.
- `idx/0x14` is `u32` floor division (non-negative); the `& 0x3F` makes the `u6`
  width explicit (the value never exceeds 62).
- No C ABI/header/ABI-inventory change.

## Changes

1. `roastty/src/font/sprite/draw.rs`: add `Sextants` (+ `from_cp`) and
   `draw_sextant`; update the module doc to note sextant coverage.
2. Tests (deterministic, the fixture `Metrics` — `cell_width = 9`,
   `cell_height = 18`). The grid cells resolve to columns `x` left `[0,5)` /
   right `[4,9)` and rows `y` top `[0,6)` / middle `[6,12)` / bottom `[12,18)`
   (18 is divisible by 3, so the thirds are clean):
   - `sextant_first` (`0x1FB00`, idx 0 → sex 1 = `tl`): only the top-left cell.
   - `sextant_second` (`0x1FB01`, idx 1 → sex 2 = `tr`): only the top-right
     cell.
   - `sextant_tl_tr` (`0x1FB02`, idx 2 → sex 3 = `tl+tr`): the whole top row.
   - `sextant_index_jump` (`0x1FB13` idx 19 → sex 20 = `ml+bl`; `0x1FB14` idx 20
     → sex 22 = `tr+ml+bl`): proves the `idx/0x14` jump at the boundary (sex
     value `21` is skipped between them).
   - `sextant_last` (`0x1FB3B`, idx 59 → sex 62 = `tr+ml+mr+bl+br`, all but
     `tl`): the top-left cell empty, the rest filled.
   - `draw_sextant_excludes`: `0x1FAFF`, `0x1FB3C`, `'M'` return `false`, draw
     nothing.
   - Cells are checked with a `cells_inked` helper that asserts every pixel
     belongs to exactly the expected set of cell rectangles.
3. Format and test (`cargo fmt`, accept output).

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo test -p roastty sprite
cargo test -p roastty
cargo build -p roastty            # no warnings
rg -n 'ghostty|Ghostty|GHOSTTY' roastty/src/font && exit 1 || true
rg -n 'ghostty|Ghostty|GHOSTTY' roastty/src/lib.rs roastty/include/roastty.h roastty/tests/abi_harness.c && exit 1 || true
git diff --check
```

The experiment **passes** if:

- `from_cp` reproduces the `idx + idx/0x14 + 1` pattern formula and the bit→cell
  mapping, and `draw_sextant` fills the right cells, returning `false` outside
  `U+1FB00`–`U+1FB3B`;
- the index-jump test confirms the `idx/0x14` skip at the boundary;
- the rest of the legacy-computing file and the `z2d` primitives stay deferred;
- `cargo fmt` accepted, `cargo build -p roastty` has no warnings, and
  `cargo test -p roastty` passes with no regressions;
- the no-`ghostty`-name gates and `git diff --check` pass;
- Codex reviews the design before implementation and the result after, with all
  real findings fixed.

The experiment is **partial** if the pattern formula needs a different integer
shape to match upstream exactly.

The experiment **fails** if the sextant pattern mapping or cell geometry
diverges from upstream or any public C API/ABI changes.

## Design Review

Codex reviewed this design before implementation and found **no required
changes**. It confirmed the bit order (`tl,tr,ml,mr,bl,br = 0x01..0x20`), that
the `sex = idx + idx/0x14 + 1` formula matches upstream and correctly skips `0`
(blank), `21` (left column), and `42` (right column), that all six `fill` cell
rectangles match upstream, and that the worked examples (`0→1 tl`, `1→2 tr`,
`2→3 tl+tr`, `19→20 ml+bl`, `20→22 tr+ml+bl`, `59→62 all-but-tl`) and the `9×18`
cell geometry (left `x[0,5)`, right `x[4,9)`, top `y[0,6)`, middle `y[6,12)`,
bottom `y[12,18)`) are correct.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

`roastty/src/font/sprite/draw.rs` gained `Sextants` (+ `from_cp`, decoding the
`idx + idx/0x14 + 1` pattern into six cell flags) and `draw_sextant` (the 2×3
grid of `fill`ed cells). The module doc now notes sextant coverage.

Tests (deterministic, the fixture; cells at columns left `[0,5)`/right `[4,9)`
and rows top `[0,6)`/middle `[6,12)`/bottom `[12,18)`). The `cells_inked` helper
asserts every cell pixel belongs to exactly the expected cell union:

- `sextant_first` (`0x1FB00`) → `tl`; `sextant_second` (`0x1FB01`) → `tr`;
  `sextant_tl_tr` (`0x1FB02`) → the top row.
- `sextant_index_jump` (`0x1FB13` → `ml+bl`, `0x1FB14` → `tr+ml+bl`) proves the
  `idx/0x14` jump skips sex value `21`.
- `sextant_last` (`0x1FB3B`) → all cells but `tl`.
- `draw_sextant_excludes` → `0x1FAFF`, `0x1FB3C`, `'M'` return `false`, draw
  nothing.

Gate results:

- `cargo fmt -p roastty` accepted; `--check` clean.
- `cargo test -p roastty sprite` → 65 passed (6 new).
- `cargo test -p roastty` → 2491 passed, 0 failed (no regressions; +6).
- `cargo build -p roastty` → no warnings.
- No-`ghostty`-name gates clean; `git diff --check` clean.

## Conclusion

The legacy-computing Sextants (`U+1FB00`–`U+1FB3B`) are ported and
pixel-verified — the skip-encoded pattern index and the six fill cells both
confirmed. Six rect/`fill`-based sprite families are now in place. The remaining
`symbols_for_legacy_computing` glyphs (smooth mosaics, separated blocks, the
larger run) lean on `canvas.line` (the `z2d` path API), so the next meaningful
step toward completing the sprite font is the **`z2d` anti-aliased-path port** —
the prerequisite for the box-drawing arcs/diagonals, the geometric-shape curves,
and those legacy glyphs. With several families landed, wiring the per-family
dispatchers under one sprite `has_codepoint`/draw entry point (which the
resolver's deferred sprite render arm needs) is also now worthwhile. Alongside
the sprite font remain the discovery consumer, the UCD emoji-presentation
default, codepoint overrides, the shaper, the Nerd Font attribute table, and SVG
color detection.

## Completion Review

Codex reviewed the completed implementation and result and found **no required
changes**. It confirmed `from_cp` matches the upstream index math and bit order
exactly, `draw_sextant` returns `false` outside `0x1FB00..=0x1FB3B`, all six
`fill` calls use the upstream fraction pairs, the `cells_inked` helper correctly
models the `9×18` fixture rects (including the 1px center-column overlap), and
the worked codepoints (`0x1FB00 tl`, `0x1FB01 tr`, `0x1FB02 tl+tr`,
`0x1FB13 ml+bl`, `0x1FB14 tr+ml+bl`, `0x1FB3B all-but-tl`) are correct. It
judged the verification clean.
