# Experiment 832: Eliminate the surface snapshot first-render race

## Description

With the poison cascade killed (Exp 831), the suite's residual failures are now
visible and few: **2–3 per run**, dominated by the surface-snapshot
**first-render race**. This experiment eliminates that race class so
`cargo test -p roastty` runs clean.

### Root cause (confirmed across Exp 830/831)

`surface_snapshot_text` (`lib.rs:15310`) and `surface_snapshot_text_after_start`
(`lib.rs:15305`, which is `roastty_surface_start` + `surface_snapshot_text`)
take the snapshot on the **first** `roastty_surface_needs_render` returned by
`wait_until`. After `start`, the surface's initial paint can set `needs_render`
**before** the child's round-trip output arrives, so the snapshot is the empty
initial screen and the following `assert!(…contains(EXPECTED))` fails. It is
timing-dependent: most tests win the race, a few lose it per run. Exp 831's runs
showed `surface_key_default_performable_action_falls_through_when_unperformed`
(`lib.rs:16314`) and
`surface_key_default_natural_text_editing_writes_legacy_bytes` (`lib.rs:16358`)
losing it 5/5.

The fix is the proven Exp 830 template: wait for the **expected output token**
(`surface_snapshot_text_until`, `lib.rs:15325`, which polls up to 300 × 10 ms
for the needle and only then renders) instead of snapshotting on the first
render. Every call site already names its expected token in `.contains(NEEDLE)`.

## Changes

`roastty/src/lib.rs` (test code only). Two helpers do the waiting; the call
sites become token-waits.

1. **Add**
   `surface_snapshot_text_after_start_until(app, surface, needle) -> String` =
   `roastty_surface_start(surface)` +
   `surface_snapshot_text_until(app, surface, needle)` (mirrors the existing
   `_after_start` wrapper but waits for the token; returns the snapshot for
   multi-assert callers).

2. **97 simple sites** — mechanical conversion (single literal needle):

   ```
   assert!(surface_snapshot_text_after_start(app, S).contains("LIT"));
       →   surface_snapshot_text_after_start_until(app, S, "LIT");
   ```

   The `_until` helper panics with the latest snapshot if `"LIT"` never appears,
   so it is exactly equivalent to the old assert, minus the race.

3. **~10 `let text = surface_snapshot_text_after_start(app, surface);` sites**
   (e.g. `surface_start_uses_copied_config…` `lib.rs:29158`, which asserts
   `contains(current_dir)` **and** `contains("owned")`). Convert to
   `let text = surface_snapshot_text_after_start_until(app, surface, KEY);`
   where `KEY` is the **last-arriving** expected token; the existing
   multi-asserts then run against the settled snapshot. Each `KEY` is chosen per
   test from its asserts (recorded in the result). KEY-selection is safe here
   because all 10 of these sites have **single-`printf`, single-burst** children
   (every asserted token renders together) — verified in design review; the
   result must call out any later site where the asserted tokens span multiple
   output bursts (a too-early KEY would return before a later token).

4. **9 `surface_snapshot_text(app, surface)` round-trip sites** (the
   non-`after_start` ones:
   `lib.rs:16313/16357/16425/16510/16646/21166/21187/21223/21489`) — convert to
   `surface_snapshot_text_until(app, surface, NEEDLE)`. One special case:
   - `lib.rs:16646` asserts `contains("^X") || contains("18")` — under the
     test's `stty -echo` the `^X` echo never renders and only the `0x18` byte
     reaches `dd|od`, so the awaited token is **`"18"`**; the `||` assert is
     kept (the `^X` arm is dead, so `_until("18")` cannot be defeated by it).

   **Two negative-assert sites are left unchanged** — both correctly keep
   `surface_snapshot_text`, since `_until` cannot wait for an _absent_ token:
   - the `!contains("byte:0c")` form-feed test; and
   - `lib.rs:21419`'s `!contains("ready")` after a `reset` binding action.
     Design review established this one is **deterministic, not a first-render
     race**: `reset` runs `worker.with_termio_mut(|t| t.terminal_mut().reset())`
     synchronously on the caller (`termio.rs:297`), so the grid is cleared and
     `needs_render` set _before_ the action returns; the snapshot is stable and
     the negative assert is sound. No positive marker exists post-reset, so this
     site stays bare.

No production code changes; all edits are in `#[cfg(test)]` test bodies and
helpers. The few remaining `surface_snapshot_text` callers that assert on
first-render content (not child round-trip) are left unchanged and identified in
the result.

## Verification

Using the **no-progress watchdog** for every bare run (kill + `sample` if the
test log is silent > 90 s, hard ceiling 600 s, and record each run's wall-clock)
so a hang self-reports in ≤ 90 s instead of waiting indefinitely:

- **Targeted (fast) first:** the two 5/5 originators
  (`surface_key_default_performable_action_falls_through_when_unperformed`,
  `surface_key_default_natural_text_editing_writes_legacy_bytes`) pass in
  isolation after conversion.
- **Full suite:** `cargo test -p roastty` (bare, in-process, under the watchdog)
  run **5×** — **zero failures** in every run (no snapshot-race originators; and
  still zero `PoisonError`, confirming 831 holds). The only acceptable residual
  is the non-PTY `config_path_cli` flake (Exp 833), which must be **explicitly
  identified** if it appears, not silently counted.
- `cargo build -p roastty --tests` — no warnings.
  `cargo fmt -p roastty -- --check` — clean. No-ghostty grep on the added lines
  — clean. `git diff --check` — clean.

**Pass** = `cargo test -p roastty` shows **zero snapshot-race failures across 5
watchdog-bounded runs** (only the separately-tracked `config_path_cli` flake may
remain, → Exp 833). **Partial/Fail** = any snapshot-race test still fails, or a
new failure class appears.

## Design Review

**Reviewer:** `adversarial-reviewer` subagent (Claude Opus, fresh context,
read-only). Verified the helper semantics, the 97/10/12 call-site counts, and
the sed-safety of the needles against the actual `lib.rs` sites.

**Verdict:** CHANGES REQUIRED → fixed → approvable. Confirmed sound: the
`surface_snapshot_text_until` mechanics, the `String` return supporting
multi-assert callers, the 97-site mechanical equivalence, and the "last-arriving
token as KEY" rule (all 10 `let text =` sites are single-burst children).

- **Required — 21419 is not a race.** Its `!contains("ready")` assert follows a
  `reset` binding action that runs `with_termio_mut` **synchronously**
  (`termio.rs:297`), so the cleared grid + `needs_render` are set before the
  action returns — the snapshot is deterministic. `_until` cannot wait for an
  _absent_ token and no positive marker exists post-reset. **Fixed:**
  reclassified 21419 as **left unchanged** (keeps `surface_snapshot_text`); the
  round-trip conversion list is now 9 sites.
- **Optional — 16646 awaited token.** **Adopted:** under `stty -echo` the `^X`
  echo never renders, so the awaited token is `"18"`; recorded.
- **Optional — KEY single-burst assumption.** **Adopted:** noted that KEY-safety
  relies on all asserted tokens sharing one output burst (true for all 10
  sites); the result must flag any multi-burst exception.

## Result

**Result:** Partial

The 116-site conversion landed (97 simple + 10 `let text =` + 9 bare round-trip
→ token-waits; the dead `surface_snapshot_text_after_start` helper removed; 2
negatives left unchanged), **and** `surface_snapshot_text_until` was changed
from a 300-iteration cap to a **30 s wall-clock deadline** (`Instant`-based)
after the iteration cap proved too brittle under contention.
Build/fmt/no-ghostty/diff clean; the 5× verification ran under the no-progress
watchdog (durations 86–356 s/run, no hang).

**The broad first-render race is fixed:** the ~106 round-trip tests that were
racing now pass across the watchdog-bounded 5× runs. But the suite is **not yet
clean** — 3 residual failures, none of which the snapshot-race conversion
addresses:

| residual failure                                                        | runs | nature                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---------------------- |
| `surface_key_default_natural_text_editing_writes_legacy_bytes`          |  4/5 | deeper bug (below)     |
| `surface_key_default_performable_action_falls_through_when_unperformed` |  4/5 | deeper bug (below)     |
| `surface_mouse_button_mode_drag_motion_uses_pressed_button`             | ~2/5 | non-snapshot flake     |
| `config::tests::config_path_cli_expands_…`                              | ~1/5 | non-PTY env/path flake |

### Why the 2 `surface_key` tests are out of scope (a different bug)

These are **not** a first-render race, so neither the token-wait nor the 30 s
deadline can fix them:

- They pass **3/3 in isolation** (~0.9 s) but fail under full-suite load — and
  they failed **before** this experiment too (5/5 in Exp 831), so the conversion
  did not change their behavior.
- They are in fact **two distinct sub-bugs** (result review):
  - `natural_text_editing` (`dd bs=1 count=1 | od -An -tx1`, asserts `^E`):
    under load the failing snapshot is literally the **od hex**
    `"           05 …"`, so the screen shows `05` not `^E` — a key-encoding /
    echo interaction under parallelism (the byte resolves/renders differently
    than in isolation).
  - `performable_action` (`dd bs=1 count=8 | od …`, asserts `^[[1;2D`): under
    load the failing snapshot is **empty** (all newlines) — `dd count=8` never
    accumulates 8 bytes so `od` never flushes; a byte-starvation mode, not
    od-hex.
- Either way, neither is a first-render snapshot race (the needle equals the
  assert, and conversion neither caused nor could fix it). Pinning them needs a
  dedicated experiment per mechanism (capture the rendered screen under load vs
  isolation; bisect the perturbing concurrent test).

## Conclusion

This experiment did its job for the **first-render snapshot race** — ~106 tests
that intermittently snapshotted before the child's output now wait for their
token and pass. The conversion + wall-clock deadline are kept.

But "suite clean" is not reached, so feature work stays paused. The residual
failures are **three distinct, separately-scoped** issues, to be fixed in order:

- **Exp 833:** the 2 `surface_key` deeper bug (isolation-pass / load-fail;
  od-hex vs control-char assert) — a key-encoding /
  global-state-under-parallelism investigation, the highest-value next target
  (4/5 failures).
- **Exp 834:** `surface_mouse_button_mode_drag_motion_uses_pressed_button` (a
  non-snapshot flake under load).
- **Exp 835:** `config::tests::config_path_cli_*` (a non-PTY env/path flake).

(Numbering note: the earlier 833/834 placeholders in the Exp 831/832 text are
superseded by this ordering, decided from the actual 5× failure data.)

## Completion Review

**Reviewer:** `adversarial-reviewer` subagent (Claude Opus, fresh context,
read-only). Verified the diff is exactly the intended conversions + helper +
deadline + dead-helper removal (no stray production change), the needles match
their asserts, and across all 10 verify runs the only failures are the 4 named
(no converted test regressed).

**Verdict:** APPROVED for a Partial — verdict, diagnosis, and next-steps
accurate and honest. Three Optional/Nit findings, adopted:

- **Two distinct surface_key mechanisms** (not one): `natural_text` shows od-hex
  `05`; `performable_action` shows an **empty** snapshot (`dd count=8`
  byte-starvation). Split into the Exp 833 hypothesis above.
- **The 30 s deadline, not the watchdog, bounds these failures** — the parallel
  suite keeps emitting `... ok` lines, so the log is never idle 90 s; a
  genuinely stuck token burns the full 30 s (this inflated failing runs to
  351–356 s, as recorded). The watchdog still backstops a _true_ whole-suite
  hang.
- **Both left-unchanged negatives named** (the `reset` `!ready` site and the
  form-feed `!byte:0c` site).
