# Experiment 1: Copy Generated Resource Packs

## Description

Restore the installed Roamium resource root so production Roamium can load the
generated Chromium resource packs introduced by the inline PDF work.

The current installed binary runs from:

```text
/opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium/roamium
```

That direct binary path is correct, but the install directory is incomplete.
`LoadTsPdfResourceBundle()` loads generated packs relative to Chromium
`DIR_ASSETS`, and the production install root does not contain the required
`gen/...` files. Roamium therefore logs `found=0` for the generated packs and
crashes while initializing extension/PDF resources.

This experiment keeps the known-good direct resource-root layout from Issue 730
and fixes both production packaging paths so the Roamium resource root preserves
the generated pack paths it now requires:

- `scripts/install.sh`, which installs directly to
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium`;
- `scripts/release.sh`, which stages `dist/release/roamium` for the Homebrew
  cask artifact that is later installed to `/opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium`.

## Changes

1. Update `scripts/install.sh`.

   Add an explicit required-resource copy path inside `install_roamium()` for
   the generated packs that `LoadTsPdfResourceBundle()` loads:

   ```text
   gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak
   gen/chrome/generated_resources_en-US.pak
   gen/chrome/common_resources.pak
   gen/components/components_resources.pak
   gen/components/strings/components_strings_en-US.pak
   gen/extensions/extensions_renderer_resources.pak
   ```

2. Update `scripts/release.sh`.

   Add the same required-resource copy path when staging `dist/release/roamium`.
   The Homebrew cask installs that staged `roamium` directory to
   `/opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium`, so release packaging must preserve the
   same relative `gen/...` paths as direct install.

3. Preserve exact relative paths under each Roamium resource root.

   Each source file under `chromium/src/out/Default/` must land at the same
   relative path under both Roamium resource roots, for example:

   ```text
   chromium/src/out/Default/gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak
   -> /opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium/gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak

   chromium/src/out/Default/gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak
   -> dist/release/roamium/gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak
   ```

4. Fail loudly on missing required packs.

   The scripts must not silently ship a partial Roamium resource root. If any
   required generated pack is missing from `chromium/src/out/Default`, both
   direct install and release packaging should fail with a clear error naming
   the missing file and telling the user to rebuild Chromium/Roamium.

5. Keep the rest of the install/release behavior unchanged.

   Do not add a symlink or wrapper. Do not change Ghostboard or webtui launch
   resolution. Do not modify Chromium code for this packaging regression. Do not
   publish a real release during this experiment.

## Verification

1. Static shell syntax:

   ```bash
   bash -n scripts/install.sh scripts/release.sh
   ```

2. Confirm required source packs exist:

   ```bash
   for path in \
     gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak \
     gen/chrome/generated_resources_en-US.pak \
     gen/chrome/common_resources.pak \
     gen/components/components_resources.pak \
     gen/components/strings/components_strings_en-US.pak \
     gen/extensions/extensions_renderer_resources.pak
   do
     test -f "chromium/src/out/Default/$path"
   done
   ```

3. Reinstall Roamium:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh roamium
   ```

4. Confirm the installed resource root contains the required generated packs:

   ```bash
   for path in \
     gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak \
     gen/chrome/generated_resources_en-US.pak \
     gen/chrome/common_resources.pak \
     gen/components/components_resources.pak \
     gen/components/strings/components_strings_en-US.pak \
     gen/extensions/extensions_renderer_resources.pak
   do
     test -f "/opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium/$path"
   done
   ```

5. Confirm release staging contains the required generated packs without
   publishing a release.

   Use local-only release staging or a testable equivalent that exercises the
   same Roamium packaging copy path without running the GitHub/Homebrew publish
   steps, then confirm:

   ```bash
   for path in \
     gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak \
     gen/chrome/generated_resources_en-US.pak \
     gen/chrome/common_resources.pak \
     gen/components/components_resources.pak \
     gen/components/strings/components_strings_en-US.pak \
     gen/extensions/extensions_renderer_resources.pak
   do
     test -f "dist/release/roamium/$path"
   done
   ```

   If the implementation does not introduce a local-only release staging mode,
   record why and verify the release packaging copy helper directly against a
   temporary staging directory instead. The verification must still prove that
   the Homebrew cask artifact path gets the six generated packs at
   `roamium/gen/...`.

6. Confirm installed Roamium can initialize its resource packs:

   ```bash
   /opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium/roamium --help
   ```

   Pass criteria:

   - no `found=0` log lines for the six generated packs;
   - no `Unable to find resource` fatal;
   - no `icudtl.dat not found` fatal.

7. Confirm production browser startup:

   Launch TermSurf Ghostboard from the installed app, then run:

   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/web \
     --browser /opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium/roamium \
     https://example.com
   ```

   Pass criteria:

   - Roamium connects back to Ghostboard;
   - the TUI leaves the `Waiting for Chromium` state;
   - the page reaches a visible loaded state.

8. Hygiene checks:

   ```bash
   git diff --check
   ```

## Design Review

Fresh-context adversarial review returned **CHANGES REQUIRED**.

Required findings:

- The original design fixed only `scripts/install.sh`, but `scripts/release.sh`
  stages the Homebrew `roamium` artifact and had the same missing-resource
  behavior.
- The original verification checked only direct install, not the release/cask
  artifact path users receive.

Fixes applied:

- Expanded the design to update both `scripts/install.sh` and
  `scripts/release.sh`.
- Added release-staging verification for the required
  `dist/release/roamium/gen/...` files.
- Added syntax checks for both touched shell scripts and `git diff --check`.

Re-review verdict: **APPROVED**. The reviewer confirmed the revised design
covers both production packaging paths, verifies the Homebrew cask staging
artifact, and includes syntax/whitespace hygiene checks. No Required findings
remain.

## Result

**Result:** Partial

Implemented a shared Roamium runtime resource copier and wired it into both
production packaging paths:

- `scripts/roamium-resources.sh` defines the required generated resource pack
  manifest, copies top-level Chromium runtime assets, preserves the required
  `gen/...` relative paths, and fails loudly if any required generated pack is
  missing from `chromium/src/out/Default`.
- `scripts/install.sh` now uses the shared copier for direct Roamium installs.
- `scripts/release.sh` now uses the same copier when staging
  `dist/release/roamium`, and gained `TERMSURF_RELEASE_PACKAGE_ONLY=1` so
  release packaging can be verified without uploading to GitHub or updating the
  Homebrew tap.

Verification performed:

```bash
bash -n scripts/roamium-resources.sh scripts/install.sh scripts/release.sh
git diff --check
```

Both passed.

The six required generated source packs were present in
`chromium/src/out/Default`:

```text
gen/chrome/pdf_resources.pak
gen/chrome/generated_resources_en-US.pak
gen/chrome/common_resources.pak
gen/components/components_resources.pak
gen/components/strings/components_strings_en-US.pak
gen/extensions/extensions_renderer_resources.pak
```

Direct install to the default production root could not run in this non-
interactive shell because `sudo` required a password:

```text
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password
sudo: a password is required
```

The same installer path was verified with an unprivileged install root:

```bash
TERMSURF_ROAMIUM_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/termsurf-issue821-install \
  ./scripts/install.sh roamium
```

All six generated packs were copied to the expected relative paths under
`/tmp/termsurf-issue821-install`.

Release staging was verified without publishing:

```bash
TERMSURF_RELEASE_PACKAGE_ONLY=1 ./scripts/release.sh 0.1.5-issue821
```

All six generated packs were copied to the expected relative paths under
`dist/release/roamium`, and `/usr/bin/tar -tzf` confirmed the generated tarball
contains each required path under `roamium/gen/...`.

Roamium was also launched from the temporary resource root under an eight-second
alarm to force a bounded standalone startup check:

```bash
perl -e 'alarm 8; exec @ARGV' \
  /tmp/termsurf-issue821-install/roamium \
  --user-data-dir=/tmp/termsurf-issue821-profile
```

The resource loader reported all six generated packs as present and loaded:

```text
pdf-resource-pak ... found=1 loaded=1
components-resource-pak ... found=1 loaded=1
components-strings-pak ... found=1 loaded=1
chrome-generated-strings-pak ... found=1 loaded=1
chrome-common-pak ... found=1 loaded=1
extensions-renderer-pak ... found=1 loaded=1
```

No `found=0`, `Unable to find resource`, or `icudtl.dat not found` line appeared
for the Roamium resource-root problem. The bounded standalone run did produce
Chromium child-process sandbox fatals (`sandbox::Seatbelt::IsSandboxed()`),
which is outside this packaging fix and is expected from launching Roamium
standalone without the full app/Ghostboard context.

The remaining unverified items are the privileged default install to
`/opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium` and the final installed Ghostboard +
`/usr/local/bin/web` GUI startup check. Those require a sudo-capable interactive
terminal on this VM.

## Conclusion

The install/release packaging regression is fixed in code and verified through
the same resource-root copy paths using unprivileged install and package-only
release staging. The Homebrew tarball path now contains the required generated
packs under `roamium/gen/...`.

The issue should stay open until the default privileged install is run and
Ghostboard is verified against `/opt/homebrew/opt/termsurf-roamium/roamium` in
the actual production location.

## Completion Review

Fresh-context adversarial review returned **APPROVED** with no Required,
Optional, or Nit findings.

The reviewer confirmed that the result commit had not already been made, both
production packaging scripts call the shared Roamium runtime resource manifest,
missing generated packs fail loudly, the README status matches the Partial
result, syntax and whitespace checks pass, and the source, temporary install,
release staging, and tarball `roamium/gen/...` paths all contain the required
generated packs.
