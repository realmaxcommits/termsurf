# Experiment 107: Mouse Runtime Subinventory

## Description

`RUNTIME-004` is still too broad to close honestly. It mixes mouse reporting,
shift capture, scroll scaling, click-repeat timing, prompt cursor movement,
mouse hiding, and right/middle click actions into one row. Some of those
behaviors already have Roastty runtime hooks and tests; others are parser-only
or app/UI behavior that should remain gaps until proven.

This experiment will split `RUNTIME-004` into explicit mouse runtime subrows and
add focused libroastty runtime guards for the subrows that are already wired
through `Surface`:

- mouse reporting enable/disable and `toggle_mouse_reporting`;
- `mouse-shift-capture` interaction with terminal `XTSHIFTESCAPE` state;
- `mouse-scroll-multiplier` precision/discrete scroll step behavior;
- `click-repeat-interval` propagation into selection click timing.

It will not claim parity for `cursor-click-to-move`, `mouse-hide-while-typing`,
`right-click-action`, or `middle-click-action` unless the implementation and
tests prove those runtime effects in this experiment. If they remain unproven,
the generated runtime inventory must keep them as mouse gaps with dedicated
follow-up rows.

## Changes

- Update `roastty/src/lib.rs` tests with focused runtime oracles for the
  `Surface` mouse settings that are already represented in runtime state:
  `mouse_reporting`, `mouse_shift_capture`, `mouse_scroll_multiplier`, and
  `click_repeat_interval_ns`.
- Reuse existing test helpers such as `new_test_config_with_mouse_behavior`,
  `set_surface_worker_mouse_mode`, and deterministic selection-click timing
  rather than adding GUI automation.
- Update `issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/config_runtime_inventory.py` to
  split the current `RUNTIME-004` row into smaller mouse subrows. Proven subrows
  may be marked `Oracle complete`; unproven click/cursor/UI subrows must remain
  `Gap`.
- Regenerate `issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/config-runtime-inventory.md`
  and update the `CFG-223` summary in
  `issues/0805-roastty-ghostty-parity/config-matrix.md`.
- Update the Issue 805 learnings with any durable conclusions about mouse
  runtime coverage and remaining gaps.

## Verification

Pass criteria:

- The new mouse runtime tests fail before the runtime behavior they guard is
  present and pass after the implementation.
- The generated runtime inventory no longer has one ambiguous `RUNTIME-004` row;
  it has explicit mouse subrows with honest statuses.
- `cursor-click-to-move`, `mouse-hide-while-typing`, `right-click-action`, and
  `middle-click-action` remain gaps unless direct runtime/UI evidence is added.
- `CFG-223` remains `Gap` until every runtime/UI row is complete, not
  applicable, or accepted as a documented divergence.

## Design Review

Adversarial design review by fresh-context Codex subagent `Curie`:

- **Initial verdict:** Changes required.
- **Required finding:** The first inventory assertion could pass while leaving
  the unsuffixed ambiguous `RUNTIME-004` row in place, and while mentioning
  unproven mouse options somewhere in the inventory without proving they had
  dedicated `Gap` rows.
- **Fix:** The verification snippet now parses runtime inventory table rows,
  rejects unsuffixed `RUNTIME-004`, asserts exact mouse subrow statuses, and
  requires the unproven cursor/mouse/right-click/middle-click options to appear
  on dedicated gap rows.
